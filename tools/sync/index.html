    <p>
      This table shows the current clock synchronization state between all receivers. It will automatically update about every 30 seconds.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Each receiver pair has two main values: the number of synchronizations done in the last approx 30 seconds (larger is better)
      and the estimated synchronization error in microseconds (smaller is better)
    </p>

    <p>
      The third value (at the bottom of each cell) is the relative frequency offset of the receiver clocks, in PPM.
      This is mostly just for interest. If you have values getting close to 200 it can be a problem, as the server will reject differences >200PPM -
      better fix your dump1090 --ppm setting!     
    </p>   
    
    <p>
      Green cells are good, yellow cells are OK, red cells are bad. Grey cells mean there is no synchronization available between that pair of receivers.
      (Sorry if you're colorblind! The colors are all configured in the stylesheet - send me better suggestions?)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      It's normal to have quite a few yellow cells for number of synchronizations (usually this is infrequent synchronization between distant receivers).
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Yellow cells for synchronization errors are uncommon - usually either the clock error is very good or very bad, there's not much middle ground.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Red cells for synchronization errors usually indicate a clock problem.
      If there's only one in a row/column it's probably a one-off outlier.
      If a whole row/column goes red that usually indicates clock instability in that receiver.
      Receiver pairs that have red cells are not used for multilateration.
    </p>

    <p>
      The PPM values are <b>relative</b> values. They don't tell you anything about the true offset. However: the Vsky receiver is a GPS-synchronized
      Radarcape that should have an accurate frequency; so the offsets between Vsky and other receivers should be close to the true offsets.
